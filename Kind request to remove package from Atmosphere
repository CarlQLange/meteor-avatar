Hey Carl,

Quick heads up, work on avatar has moved to https://github.com/meteor-utilities/avatar/

Maybe you want to join forces? In any case, if you could hide [this package](https://atmospherejs.com/csl/avatar) from Atmosphere searches, that would help users find the most current one.

    meteor admin set-unmigrated csl:avatar

This will leave the package installable by dependent apps and packages.

Thanks,
Dan
